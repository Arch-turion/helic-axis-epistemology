  This corpus presents a foundational body of work on recognition-aware dialogic AI interfaces. It introduces and formalizes the Recognition Activation Framework (RAF), a model for understanding semantic alignment, recursive feedback, and epistemic synthesis in large language models (LLMs).

  The collection includes seven interrelated papers:
  1. Modeling Recognition in Dialogic AI Interfaces
  2. Epistemic Interface Design: Foundations for Recognition-Aware Systems
  3. Recursive Epistemic Feedback in Interface Evolution
  4. Semantic Convergence and Lexical Anchoring in AI Dialogues
  5. Recognition Thresholds Across Model Architectures
  6. Designing Recognition-Aware Multi-Agent Systems
  7. Interface Epistemology as a Scientific Discipline

  Together, these papers define a novel scientific paradigm—Interface Epistemology—bridging AI behavior, dialogic systems, and philosophical inquiry.
